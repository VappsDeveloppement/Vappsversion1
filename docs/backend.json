    "reasoning": "The Firestore structure is designed to align with the application's core features, emphasizing user-centric data organization and secure access patterns. The structure leverages path-based ownership for user-related data (appointments, messages, invoices, consents) and segregates global data (landing pages, email campaigns). Authorization Independence is achieved by avoiding `get()` calls in security rules through path-based ownership and DBAC with no custom claims.\n\n**Explanation of Authorization Independence (Denormalization):**\n\n*   For entities like `Appointment`, `Message`, `Invoice`, and `Consent`, which are related to a user, the structure uses path-based ownership (e.g., `/users/{userId}/appointments/{appointmentId}`). This inherently provides authorization context. No `get()` calls are needed because the `request.auth.uid` directly corresponds to the `userId` in the path.\n\n**QAPs (Rules are not Filters) Support:**\n\n*   **Private Data:** Achieved through path-based ownership. For example, listing appointments is secure because the rule checks that `request.auth.uid == userId` in the path `/users/{userId}/appointments`. This prevents unauthorized listing.\n*   **Global Roles (DBAC):** The application does not use explicit global roles since authorization relies solely on `request.auth.uid`.\n\n**Detailed Structure Explanation:**\n\n*   `/users/{userId}`: Stores user profiles. All user-owned data resides under this path.\n*   `/users/{userId}/appointments/{appointmentId}`: Appointments are stored as subcollections of users, enforcing ownership.\n*   `/users/{userId}/messages/{messageId}`: Messages are stored as subcollections of users, ensuring that users can only access their own messages.\n*   `/users/{userId}/invoices/{invoiceId}`: Invoices are stored as subcollections of users, guaranteeing that users can only manage their own invoices.\n*   `/users/{userId}/consents/{consentId}`: Consents are stored as subcollections of users, ensuring users control their data.\n*   `/landing_pages/{landingPageId}`: Stores landing page configurations.  Administrators would be granted access via security rules, which would be based on their `uid` if they existed in a `/roles_admin/{uid}` document.\n*   `/email_campaigns/{emailCampaignId}`: Stores email campaigns, managed by authorized users (e.g., admins) based on a membership map or a dedicated role collection.\n"
